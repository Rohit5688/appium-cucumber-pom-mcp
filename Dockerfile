# Dockerfile for AppForge
# Uses Node base image. Appium and WebdriverIO will be executed natively within the container.
# Note: This image contains the MCP server and Node dependencies. To test against local mobile emulators (Android/iOS), 
# you must configure the Docker container to access the host machine's network (e.g., --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway).
