## 3. 📱 Live Device Interaction

### 3.1 Starting Live Device Session for Context

```
Start a live Appium session for my [android/ios] app to gather real-time context:

Configuration:
- Device Profile: [PROFILE_NAME from mcp-config.json or "default"]
- App Package/Bundle: [PACKAGE_ID]
- Purpose: [screen inspection/test development/debugging]

After connection:
1. Capture current screen hierarchy (XML)
2. Take screenshot for visual reference
3. Use this context to [generate accurate locators/debug failing test/verify element existence]
```

**Example:**

```
Start a live Appium session for my android app to gather real-time context:

Configuration:
- Device Profile: pixel8_emulator
- App Package: com.shopping.app
- Purpose: screen inspection for checkout flow

After connection:
1. Capture current screen hierarchy (XML)
2. Take screenshot for visual reference
3. Use this context to generate accurate locators for payment screen Page Object
```

---

### 3.2 Inspecting Current Screen Elements

```
With the active Appium session, inspect the current screen and:
1. List all interactive elements with their locator strategies
2. Identify unique identifiers (accessibility-id, resource-id, etc.)
3. Highlight elements suitable for [test action you need]
4. Suggest optimal locator strategy based on element properties

Focus on: [specific UI section/entire screen]
```

---

### 3.3 Verifying Selector in Real-Time

```
Verify if the following selector works on the current screen:
Selector: [YOUR_SELECTOR]
Strategy: [accessibility-id/xpath/id/etc.]

If it doesn't work:
- Suggest alternatives from the current screen hierarchy
- Explain why the original selector failed
- Provide the corrected selector
```

_Note: A successful verification intrinsically auto-learns the fix into the project brain! No extra prompt needed._

**Example:**

```
Verify if the following selector works on the current screen:
Selector: ~checkout_button
Strategy: accessibility-id

If it doesn't work:
- Suggest alternatives from the current screen hierarchy
- Explain why the original selector failed
- Provide the corrected selector
```

- Error Output: [PASTE_ERROR_MESSAGE]

Actions Required:
1. Analyze the failure (element not found/timeout/assertion/etc.)
2. Start live Appium session if needed to inspect current UI
3. Identify the broken selector: [SUSPECTED_SELECTOR if known]
4. Propose corrected locator using live hierarchy
5. Update affected Page Object(s) and step definitions
6. Learn this fix for future prevention (save to knowledge base)
```

**Example:**

```
Heal the failing test with the following information:

Test Details:

Error: [ERROR_MESSAGE]

Debugging approach:
1. Start Appium session
2. Navigate to failing screen: [NAVIGATION_STEPS]
3. Capture screenshot + XML hierarchy
4. Compare visual vs XML to understand element structure
5. Identify why selector "[FAILING_SELECTOR]" doesn't match
6. Provide comprehensive fix with explanation
```

---

### 4.3 Batch Healing Multiple Failed Tests

```
Multiple tests are failing after app update. Heal the following:

Failed Tests:
1. [TEST_1] - Error: [ERROR_1]
2. [TEST_2] - Error: [ERROR_2]
3. [TEST_3] - Error: [ERROR_3]

Approach:
- Start session once and inspect all affected screens

## 10. 🧠 Training the AI Assistant

AppForge includes a **Learning Service** that allows the AI to learn from successful test healings and build a knowledge base. This "AI memory" helps prevent recurring issues and improves automation quality over time.

### 10.1 Understanding the Learning System

The AI learns automatically when:
- Tests are successfully healed using the `self_heal_test` tool
- You explicitly teach patterns using prompts
- Failed locators are corrected and verified

**Knowledge is stored in**: `.mcp-knowledge.json` in your project root

---

### 10.2 Teaching the AI a Pattern
```

Teach the AI this pattern to remember for future test generation:

Pattern: [DESCRIBE_THE_PATTERN]
Context: [WHEN_TO_APPLY]
Solution: [WHAT_TO_DO]
Tags: [RELEVANT_TAGS for easier retrieval, e.g., locators, android, ios, login]

Example Pattern:
"When dealing with dynamic IDs in the checkout flow, always prefer accessibility-id over resource-id because the app generates random suffixes like \_12345"

Save this to the knowledge base so it's used in future test generation and healing.

```

**Example:**
```

Teach the AI this pattern to remember for future test generation:

Pattern: Payment button locator changes based on payment method
Context: When generating or healing tests for the payment screen
Solution: Use the accessibility-id "payment_submit_button" which remains constant across all payment methods (credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay), instead of the text-based selector which changes to "Pay Now", "Pay with PayPal", etc.
Tags: payment, locators, cross-platform, checkout

Save this to the knowledge base so it's used in future test generation and healing.

```

---

### 10.3 Reviewing What the AI Has Learned
```

Show me the current knowledge base for this project:

Display:

1. All learned patterns and solutions
2. When each was learned (timestamp)
3. How many times each pattern has been referenced
4. Categories/tags of knowledge

Format: [Markdown table/detailed list/JSON]

```

---

### 10.4 Teaching App-Specific Conventions
```

Teach the AI about our app's specific conventions:

App Conventions:

- [CONVENTION_1]: [DESCRIPTION]
- [CONVENTION_2]: [DESCRIPTION]
  [...]

Examples:

- All buttons use accessibility-id with suffix "\_btn"
- Android uses "com.myapp:id/" prefix for all resource IDs
- iOS screens use "Screen\_" prefix for accessibility identifiers
- Input fields follow pattern: "[field_name]\_input"
- Error messages appear in element with id "error_banner"

Store these conventions for consistent test generation.

```

**Example:**
```

Teach the AI about our app's specific conventions:

App Conventions:

- All primary action buttons use accessibility-id ending with "\_primary_btn"
- Secondary buttons end with "\_secondary_btn"
- Input fields use pattern "[screen_name]\_[field_purpose]\_input"
- All modals/dialogs have accessibility-id starting with "modal\_"
- Success messages: id="success_toast", error messages: id="error_toast"
- Loading indicators always use accessibility-id "loading_spinner"
- Navigation bar items use format "nav\_[destination]"

Store these conventions for consistent test generation.

```

---

### 10.5 Training on Screen Navigation Patterns
```

Teach the AI the navigation flow for [FEATURE_NAME]:

Navigation Steps:

1. [STEP_1]: [SCREEN_TO_SCREEN with actions]
2. [STEP_2]: [SCREEN_TO_SCREEN with actions]
   [...]

Key Elements for Each Screen:

- [SCREEN_NAME]:
  - Primary identifier: [LOCATOR]
  - Key elements: [LIST_KEY_ELEMENTS]
  - Navigation actions: [HOW_TO_ENTER/EXIT]

Use this for accurate test generation and healing navigation.

```

**Example:**
```

Teach the AI the navigation flow for Checkout Process:

Navigation Steps:

1. Cart Screen → Tap "checkout_btn" → Shipping Screen
2. Shipping Screen → Fill address fields → Tap "continue_to_payment_btn" → Payment Screen
3. Payment Screen → Select payment method → Fill card details → Tap "complete_order_btn" → Confirmation Screen
4. Confirmation Screen → Verify "order_confirmation_message" → Tap "view_order_btn" → Order Details Screen

Key Elements for Each Screen:

- Cart Screen:
  - Primary identifier: ~cart_title
  - Key elements: item_list, subtotal_text, checkout_btn
  - Navigation: Main tab → Cart icon
- Shipping Screen:
  - Primary identifier: ~shipping_address_title
  - Key elements: address_line1_input, city_input, zip_input, continue_to_payment_btn
  - Back: shipping_back_btn
- Payment Screen:
  - Primary identifier: ~payment_method_title
  - Key elements: card_number_input, expiry_input, cvv_input, complete_order_btn
  - Back: payment_back_btn

Use this for accurate test generation and healing navigation.

```

---

### 10.6 Teaching Error Patterns and Recovery
```

Teach the AI common error patterns and recovery strategies:

Error Scenario: [ERROR_DESCRIPTION]
Symptoms: [HOW_TO_IDENTIFY]
Root Cause: [WHY_IT_HAPPENS]
Solution: [HOW_TO_FIX]
Prevention: [HOW_TO_AVOID]

Tag: [error-handling/recovery/network/etc.]

```

**Example:**
```

Teach the AI common error patterns and recovery strategies:

Error Scenario: Network timeout during payment processing
Symptoms:

- Test hangs on payment screen
- "payment_loading_spinner" never disappears
- No error message displayed after 30+ seconds
  Root Cause: App doesn't handle network timeouts gracefully, spinner keeps spinning
  Solution:
- Wait for max 30 seconds for spinner
- Force navigate back and retry
- Check for error toast with longer timeout
  Prevention:
- Add explicit network failure test scenarios
- Use shorter timeouts in test (20s max)
- Verify error states are reachable

Tag: network, error-handling, payment, flaky-tests

```

---

### 10.7 Bulk Training from Documentation
```

I have app documentation that describes UI patterns and conventions. Extract and learn from it:

Documentation: [PASTE_DOCUMENTATION or PATH_TO_FILE]

Extract and save:

- UI element naming conventions
- Screen flow patterns
- Common locator strategies
- Platform-specific differences
- Error handling approaches
- Accessibility guidelines

Create a comprehensive knowledge base entry for each pattern found.

```

---

### 10.8 Forgetting Outdated Patterns
```

Remove this outdated pattern from the knowledge base:

Pattern to Remove: [DESCRIPTION or PATTERN_ID]
Reason: [WHY_IT'S_NO_LONGER_VALID]

Examples of reasons:

- UI redesign changed element structure
- App switched frameworks (React Native → Flutter)
- Locator strategy changed company-wide
- Screen was removed from app

```

**Example:**
```

Remove this outdated pattern from the knowledge base:

Pattern to Remove: "Use resource-id 'submit_button' for checkout"
Reason: App UI was redesigned in v3.0. The checkout button now uses accessibility-id 'checkout_submit_btn' and the old resource-id no longer exists.

```

---

### 10.9 Exporting Knowledge for Team Sharing
```

Export the knowledge base to share with the team:

Export Format: [Markdown/JSON/CSV]
Include:

- All learned patterns
- Usage statistics
- Creation/modification dates
- Tags and categories

Purpose: [team onboarding/documentation/backup/migration]

```

---

### 10.10 Importing Team Knowledge
```

Import knowledge from another project or team member:

Source: [FILE_PATH or PASTE_JSON]
Merge Strategy: [replace duplicates/keep both/skip conflicts]

Validate:

- Check for conflicts with existing patterns
- Verify patterns are still relevant
- Update tags if needed

```

### 11.4 Session Health & Port Contention
```

I'm getting timeout errors or "port in use" issues. Can you check my session health:

Tools to use:

1. Call `get_session_metrics` to view current active Appium lockfiles and project allocations.
2. Tell me if there are abandoned sessions holding lockfiles.
3. Check the Logger traces for any abrupt test crashes without teardowns.

```

## 12. ⚡ Token-Optimized Code Mode (Sandbox)

If your project is huge and returning full ASTs or files crashes the conversation, tell the AI to use the **Token Optimizer** sandbox mode.

### 12.1 Extracting Data Quietly
```

Using the sandbox (`execute_sandbox_code`), read my `wdio.conf.ts` or `mcp-config.json` and return ONLY the current platform and emulator capabilities. Do NOT send me the entire file.

```

### 12.2 Analyzing Project Statistics
```

Using the sandbox, analyze my codebase and tell me exactly how many step definitions exist and how many Page Objects use the `~` accessibility id selector.

```

## 📝 Best Practices for Prompting

### ✅ DO:
- **Be Specific**: Include exact file paths, element names, and configurations
- **Provide Context**: Share error messages, stack traces, and environment details
- **State Intent**: Explain what you're trying to achieve, not just what to do
- **Include Constraints**: Mention architectural patterns, coding standards, or limitations
- **Request Validation**: Ask the AI to validate before writing files
- **Ask for Analysis First**: Request codebase analysis before generation to avoid duplication

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Be Vague**: "Fix my tests" → Instead: "Fix the login test that's failing on line 45 with selector error"
- **Assume Context**: Don't assume the AI remembers previous conversations
- **Skip Analysis**: Don't ask to generate code without analyzing existing codebase first
- **Ignore Errors**: Share complete error messages, not summaries
- **Rush**: Give the AI time to analyze, validate, and execute properly

## 🚀 Quick Start Workflow

**For a New Project:**
1. Use prompt [1.1](#11-starting-a-brand-new-project) to set up project
2. Use prompt [7.2](#72-checking-environment-readiness) to verify environment
3. Use prompt [2.1](#21-generating-a-new-feature-with-page-objects) to create first test

**For Existing Project:**
1. Use prompt [1.2](#12-analyzing-existing-project-structure) to understand codebase
2. Use prompt [5.1](#51-analyzing-test-coverage) to find gaps
3. Use prompt [2.1](#21-generating-a-new-feature-with-page-objects) or [2.2](#22-adding-scenarios-to-existing-feature) to expand coverage

**When Tests Fail:**
1. Use prompt [4.1](#41-healing-a-failed-test) for self-healing
2. If still unclear, use prompt [3.1](#31-starting-live-device-session-for-context) for live inspection
3. Use prompt [4.2](#42-debugging-with-vision--xml-context) for complex issues

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always Analyze First**: Before generating new code, ask the AI to analyze your codebase to avoid duplication
2. **Use Live Sessions**: When creating new Page Objects, start a live Appium session for accurate locators
3. **Learn from Healing**: When tests self-heal, the AI saves learnings - these prevent future failures
4. **Batch Operations**: When possible, group related tasks in one prompt for efficiency
5. **Validate Before Writing**: Use dry-run modes to preview changes before committing
6. **Layer Your Prompts**: Break complex tasks into steps: analyze → plan → generate → validate → execute
